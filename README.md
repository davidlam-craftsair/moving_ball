# Bouncing Ball

## Description 
This is an javascript exercise for a bouncing ball within the browser window.

## Roadmap
There will be improvement like user can use mouse to control the initial ball position in the window area. I also plan to add a hole in the screen, which the ball can fall into and then the ball will disappear, and user can reposition the ball in the window area.
